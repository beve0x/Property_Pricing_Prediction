# Property_Pricing_Prediction


<!-- Overview Section -->
## Overview
The Property Pricing Prediction project aims to leverage the power of R and its associated packages to predict real estate prices based on historical property data. By employing advanced data processing techniques and predictive modeling, this project seeks to provide accurate property valuation, which is invaluable for investors, real estate professionals, and policy-makers.

<!-- Installation Section -->
## Installation
To get started with this project, you'll need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. Follow these steps to install the necessary R packages:
```r
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("writexl")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("glmnet")

<!-- Project Structure Section -->
Project Structure
The project is organized into an R Markdown document (PropertyPricingPrediction.Rmd), which contains:

Library Imports: Loading of required R libraries.
Data Loading and Cleaning: Procedures to import and clean the dataset.
Data Manipulation and Preparation: Feature engineering and data preprocessing steps.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implementation of predictive models and their evaluation.
<!-- Usage Section -->
Usage
To run the project:

Open the PropertyPricingPrediction.Rmd file in RStudio.
Execute the R Markdown file to perform the analysis. This will generate a report that combines code execution with its outputs and interpretations.
<!-- Data Preparation Section -->
Data Preparation
This phase involves cleaning and preparing the historical property data for modeling. The steps include removing non-predictive variables, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature engineering to enhance model performance.

<!-- Model Training and Evaluation Section -->
Model Training and Evaluation
We utilize the glmnet package to fit a Lasso regression model, chosen for its efficiency in feature selection and ability to handle multicollinearity. The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation, with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the metric for accuracy assessment.
